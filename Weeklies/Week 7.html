        <h5><br>>> >> >> Process</h5>
        <p>>> >> >> I found 4 different methods for generating rocks, each increasingly building upon one another:</p>
        <h4>>> >> >> >> 1 - Decimate:</h5>
        <p>>> >> >> >> I took a cube, subdivided it, displaced each of the vertices along the vertex normals based on
            a randomly generated voronoi pattern. After this, I used a decimate modifier to clear up the extra geometry
            along smooth planes.
        </p>
        <h4>>> >> >> >> 2 - Subdivision Surface:</h5>
        <p>>> >> >> >> I started the same as I did in the first method, except before I implemented the decimate modifier,
            I utilized the Catmull-Clark subdivision surface algorithm to get smoother edges.
        </p>
        <h4>>> >> >> >> 3 - Remesh:</h5>
        <p>>> >> >> >> I again inserted a new function, this time before the subdivision surface modifier.
            This addition was the remesh modifier, which cleans up the geometry of the mesh. This helps by
            allowing the SubSurf modifier to have a more even area to subdivide, preventing the detail destructive
            dulling of edges.
        </p>
        <h4>>> >> >> >> 4 - N-gons:</h5>
        <p>>> >> >> >> I wanted to create more contrast between the flat faces of the rocks and their jagged edges.
            To do this I added yet another step right before my previous addition; this time a manual step. After
            the voronoi displacement, I manually deleted the verteces of the flat sections of rock. Now when the
            model is remeshed, it will keep the flat areas especially flat.
        </p>
        <h5><br>>> >> >> Reflections</h5>
        <p>>> >> >> After going through the process of making these rocks, I realized the value of iterating on
            quicker parts of the project, because this process will yield more interesting results that the
            initial iteration. This is not as practical for larger endeavors, like ehat I have been working on
            till now. I now see the value of going through the process of sketching out the designs before
            jumping into Blender. The expedited nature of sketches allows for rapid iteration, whose design
            improvements are then embodied to the final model.

        <h2>>> >> Grass Modeling: 1.5 Hours</h2>

            alt="Grass Cluster" width="600" height="auto">
        <h5><br>>> >> >> Process</h5>
        <p>>> >> >> I began by making a simple upright grass blade with 7 faces. I then added a curve modifier and
            bent it so that it looks more dynamic. I repeated this 4 more times and joined all the objects into a single
            mesh.<br>
        </p>
        <h5><br>>> >> >> Reflections</h5>
        <p>>> >> >> When something reusable, like grass, is made, it is based to make it modular. The advantage to this
            is that only one model has to be made and only one model has to be called. This model can be used in this manner by
            randomizing the rotations of every object, so the camera shows a different view of each instantiation of the
            same mesh and the player cannot tell that the meshes are the same.
