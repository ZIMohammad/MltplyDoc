            two on either side, and one in the back. In addition, there are halls connecting the towers to one another.
            The doors have intrusions and knobs for extra detail. A pathway is indicated by stones by the entrance gate.

            From the flat side in the front, a building extrudes. This then connects to the back through
            a hall that bisects the courtyard, splitting it in two.
