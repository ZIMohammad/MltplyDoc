        <h5><br>>> >> >> Description</h5>
        <p>>> >> >> The buildings themselves consist of one large stone tower connected to three smaller stone towers,
            two on either side, and one in the back. In addition, there are halls connecting the towers to one another.
            The doors have intrusions and knobs for extra detail. A pathway is indicated by stones by the entrance gate.
        </p>
        <h5><br>>> >> >> Process</h5>
        <p>>> >> >> I started with a box and scaled the top to add a cartoonish look. Battlements were added atop this.
            This model was scaled down and duplicated to the left, right, and back of the central building. Fewer
            battlements were given to these to emphasize the difference in scale. Halls were added between the buildings
            and doors were added on them. Finally, shields were added to the central building as there were in Halina's
            thumbnail sketch.

        <h5><br>>> >> >> Description</h5>
        <p>>> >> >> The basic shape of this castle is a pentagon, with the pointed side in the back.
            From the flat side in the front, a building extrudes. This then connects to the back through
            a hall that bisects the courtyard, splitting it in two.

        <h5><br>>> >> >> Process</h5>
        <p>>> >> >> The thumbnail sketch I was told to work with looked nice from the angle it was being viewed at,
            but there was no information that could communicate to me what it would look like from other angles.
            Eventually, I came across a <a href="https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/beautiful-majestic-castle-high-angle_23-2150791503.jpg" ref="castle">
                picture of a castle
            </a> that gave a different angle of a similarly designed castle. I worked with this design. I started with a
            pentagon for the walls, then bisected it to form a main hall and two courtyards. Then a gate was extruded from
            the lower wall and towers were added to each corner of the castle. I added both battlements and cones to the
            corners of the towers as in the reference photo, this served to break the potential monotony of a repetitive
            pattern.
