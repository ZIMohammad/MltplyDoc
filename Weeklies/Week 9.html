        <h5><br>>> >> >> Process</h5>
        <p>>> >> >> I took the VFX I made last week, made their particles larger, fewer, and implemented custom
            sprites as the particles.
        </p>
        <p>>> >> >> >> First I took the Spellcast, and Wizard VFX and made their particles bigger and fewer, this produced
            an effect that was cartoonier and more alligned with the style guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>>> >> >> >> Next I made a custom sprite for the arrow particle effects and implemented this. I adjusted the
            animation curves in order to make the particle move faster.
        </p>
        <p>>> >> >> >> Finally, I adjusted the Spell Hit. This was a long process. First I implemented the cloud and smoke particles
            that were in the Unity assets file. Next I made the particles bigger and fewer. Because of this change, I had
            to adjust the speed and gravitational influence of the particles. This took the longest, but because of this
            it now looks much closer to the other assets in the game.
